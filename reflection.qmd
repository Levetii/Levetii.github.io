# 🤖 Reflection on the use of GenAI

Throughout the process of completing this website assignment, I used **ChatGPT**, a Generative AI tool developed by OpenAI, to support and streamline my workflow. The assistance it provided was both time-saving and educational.

---

## 💡 Why I Chose GenAI

I chose to use ChatGPT because I wanted fast, structured guidance for:
- Understanding **Quarto syntax**
- Generating content for `.qmd` files
- Formatting YAML headers and CSS styling
- Summarizing and organizing ideas clearly

It allowed me to focus more on content curation and personal input rather than struggling with formatting or markdown structure.

---

## ✅ How It Helped

Here are specific examples of how GenAI supported me:

- 🏠 Helped me write my **homepage** with a balanced tone between personal and professional.
- 🎮 Assisted in structuring my **ProjectRGB (FYP)** page with technical clarity.
- 🌆 Generated content for my **Chongqing trip** using my uploaded images and descriptions.
- 🎨 Suggested adjustments in `style.css` to resize images and improve layout.
- 📚 Guided me in updating `_quarto.yml` to ensure navigation worked correctly.

---

## 🌟 Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Saved a lot of time when generating or cleaning up markdown content.
- **Clarity**: Provided well-structured examples and templates I could adapt.
- **Learning**: Improved my understanding of Quarto, markdown, and how to apply custom styles.

## ⚠️ Challenges

- AI-generated text sometimes lacked personal voice or nuance — I had to edit for tone and accuracy.
- I needed to double-check code blocks to ensure they met the lab's requirements exactly.

---

## 🔮 Future Use of GenAI

I plan to continue using GenAI tools for:

- Generating boilerplate code and documentation  
- Writing summaries or technical descriptions  
- Brainstorming structure for larger reports or projects

However, I will always verify and revise AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with context, requirements, and originality.
